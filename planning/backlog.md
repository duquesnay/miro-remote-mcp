## Collaborative Workflow Capabilities (Added 2025-12-03)

These capabilities emerged from real-world usage of the MCP server on a complex organizational board (115 people, 5 domains, 16 teams). They address human-AI collaboration patterns and reduce API call overhead for complex boards.

### CAP-BOARD-SYNC: Agent AI retrieves complete board snapshot in single request

**Outcome**: Agent reduces board discovery from 10-20 paginated API calls to 1 comprehensive snapshot

**User Story**:
> As an agent AI working on a Miro board,
> I want to retrieve a complete snapshot of the board in a single request,
> So that I have a full view without making 10+ paginated calls.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- New function `sync_board(board_id)` returns ALL items on board
- Includes all types: shapes, sticky_notes, text, frames, connectors
- Format structured by type for easier processing
- Handles pagination internally (invisible to caller)
- Returns board metadata (dimensions, last modified timestamp)

**Value**: Foundation for collaborative workflow - enables quick detection of human changes, reduces latency 10-20x

**Complexity**: M (Medium)

**Technical Notes**:
- Uses existing Miro REST API pagination
- Orchestrates multiple `list_items` calls internally
- Returns structured format: `{metadata: {...}, items: {shapes: [...], sticky_notes: [...], ...}}`

---

### CAP-BATCH-UPDATE: Agent AI updates multiple items atomically

**Outcome**: Agent repositions 10 items in 1 request instead of 10 sequential calls

**User Story**:
> As an agent AI positioning multiple dozens of items,
> I want to update multiple items in a single request,
> So that I reduce latency and have atomic operations.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Function `batch_update_items(board_id, updates)` accepts array of updates
- Format: `[{id: "...", position: {...}, style: {...}}, ...]`
- Executes all updates in parallel server-side
- Returns results with success/error status for each item
- Reasonable limit (e.g., 50 items per batch)

**Value**: Reduces latency dramatically for repositioning tasks, enables "all or nothing" reliability

**Complexity**: M (Medium)

**Technical Notes**:
- Parallel execution using Rust async/await
- Individual item failures don't block entire batch
- Returns detailed status per item for error handling

---

### CAP-CHANGE-DETECTION: Agent AI detects board changes since last read

**Outcome**: Agent identifies human edits instantly without re-reading entire board

**User Story**:
> As an agent AI working in parallel with a human,
> I want to detect quickly what changed on the board since my last read,
> So that I adapt my plan without overwriting human modifications.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Function `get_board_changes(board_id, since_timestamp)` returns deltas
- Identifies items created, modified, deleted
- For modifications, indicates which fields changed (position, content, style)
- Uses Miro native timestamps (`modifiedAt`)
- Clear diff format: `{created: [...], updated: [...], deleted: [...]}`

**Value**: Prevents conflicts between human and AI actions, enables "human structures, AI fills" workflow

**Complexity**: L (Large)

**Technical Notes**:
- Requires caching previous board state or leveraging Miro modification timestamps
- May need local state management (cache last sync timestamp)
- Consider WebSocket integration for real-time change notifications (future enhancement)

---

### CAP-SPATIAL-SEARCH: Agent AI finds items in geographic zone

**Outcome**: Agent finds "the rectangle at x=1500, y=200" without parsing all items

**User Story**:
> As an agent AI searching for a containing rectangle,
> I want to find all items in a geographic area,
> So that I quickly identify structures without parsing all items.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Function `find_items_in_area(board_id, x, y, width, height, type?)`
- Returns items whose center is in specified zone
- Optional filter by item type
- Results sorted by z-index (visual layer) or creation timestamp
- Handles Miro "center" coordinate system correctly

**Value**: Instant location-based searches, identifies already-positioned items, useful for post-modification verification

**Complexity**: M (Medium)

**Technical Notes**:
- Requires full board sync first (builds on CAP-BOARD-SYNC)
- Spatial indexing on server-side for performance
- Coordinate system: center-based (Miro native)
- Bounding box calculation: `top = y - height/2`, `bottom = y + height/2`, etc.

---

### CAP-STRUCTURED-INVENTORY: Agent AI understands board hierarchy automatically

**Outcome**: Agent comprehends "5 domains, 16 teams, 115 people" structure immediately

**User Story**:
> As an agent AI analyzing an organizational board,
> I want a pre-structured inventory by zones/semantic types,
> So that I understand the structure without manual parsing.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Function `get_structured_inventory(board_id)` analyzes board
- Automatically detects parent frames
- Groups items by parent frame
- Identifies containing rectangles (thick border, transparent fill)
- Separates "structure" items vs "content" items
- Hierarchical format: `{frames: {frame_id: {metadata: {...}, children: [...]}}}`

**Value**: Instant comprehension of complex boards, reduces cognitive analysis load, foundation for intelligent positioning calculations

**Complexity**: L (Large)

**Technical Notes**:
- Heuristics for detecting "structure" elements (frames, thick-bordered rectangles)
- Builds parent-child relationships from `parent_id` and spatial containment
- Returns semantic categorization (domains, teams, people for org charts)
- Extensible pattern matching for different board types

## EPIC-SDK-BRIDGE: Web SDK Bridge App (Added 2025-12-03)

**Outcome**: Agent AI controls z-index, selection, and grouping via Miro Web SDK bridge

### Overview

REST API cannot control z-index, selection, or grouping. These features require the Web SDK which only runs in-browser. This epic creates a Miro App that bridges our MCP server to Web SDK capabilities via WebSocket.

**Architecture**: MCP Server ↔ WebSocket ↔ Miro App (iframe) ↔ Web SDK

**Constraint**: Board must be open in browser with app active (mitigated by Playwright/Chromium MCP automation)

### Capabilities

| ID | Capability | Tool |
|----|------------|------|
| CAP-ZINDEX-FRONT | Agent brings item to front | `sdk_bring_to_front(board_id, item_id)` |
| CAP-ZINDEX-BACK | Agent sends item to back | `sdk_send_to_back(board_id, item_id)` |
| CAP-SELECTION-READ | Agent sees user's selection | `sdk_get_selection(board_id)` |
| CAP-SELECTION-WRITE | Agent selects items | `sdk_select(board_id, item_ids[])` |
| CAP-GROUPING | Agent groups items | `sdk_group(board_id, item_ids[])` |
| CAP-UNGROUPING | Agent ungroups items | `sdk_ungroup(board_id, group_id)` |

**Value**: Bidirectional interaction - Claude sees what user selected and can manipulate layer order

### Components

| Component | Effort | Files |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Miro App (Web SDK) | 2-3 days | `miro-bridge-app/` (new project) |
| WebSocket Hub | 1-2 days | `src/websocket-hub.ts` (new) |
| MCP Tools | 1 day | `src/tools.ts` (extend) |
| Infrastructure | 0.5 day | Docker, Miro Developer Portal |
| Tests & Debug | 1-2 days | Integration tests |
| **TOTAL** | **5-8 days** | |

### Technical Capabilities (From Review 2025-12-02)

- [ ] TECH1: User creates tree diagrams at scale without waiting (vs 30s for 100 nodes)
- [ ] TECH2: Developer modifies batch creation logic in single location (vs 3 duplicate handlers)
- [ ] TECH3: Developer extends auth logic with full type safety (vs type assertion hack)
- [ ] TECH4: Developer works with clean production build (vs test files in dist/)
- [ ] TECH5: Developer navigates layout code without dead paths (vs unused custom layout)
- [ ] TECH6: System responds instantly for repeated item queries (vs re-fetching every time)

- [ ] TECH8: Developer deploys with confidence OAuth and MCP protocol work correctly

### API Limitations (Not Fixable)

**Fonts**:
- ✅ Shapes/Text: Font family and size controllable via API
- ❌ Sticky notes: No font control - size auto-scales with sticky dimensions
- ❌ Sticky notes: Text color not modifiable
- ✅ HTML formatting: `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<p>` work in content

**Z-Index / Layers**:
- ❌ REST API has NO z-index control
- ❌ Only Web SDK has `bringToFront()`, `sendToBack()`, `bringInFrontOf()`
- ⚠️ Creation order = stacking order by default
- ⚠️ Frames always at bottom (parent container behavior)
- ⚠️ Items added to frame inherit frame's layer index

**Workarounds**:
- For z-order: Create items in desired back-to-front order
- For fonts: Use sticky size to control text size
- For emphasis: Use HTML tags in content

### Deprecated (Removed from Scope)

- [x] ~~OPS-SCALEWAY: Deploy to Scaleway Functions~~ → Deprecated: HTTP gateway approach preferred
- [x] ~~CAP-STDIO-TRANSPORT: Local stdio transport~~ → Deprecated: HTTP-only deployment

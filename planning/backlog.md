# Backlog - Miro MCP

## Planned

### High: Feature Capabilities
- [ ] CAP-BOARD-SYNC: Agent AI retrieves complete board state in single request
- [ ] CAP-BATCH-UPDATE: Agent AI updates multiple board items atomically

### Medium: Quality & Performance
- [ ] TECH6: Agent AI responds instantly for repeated board searches (caching)
- [ ] TECH7: System maintains stable memory footprint under sustained high usage
- [ ] TECH-RATE-LIMITS: System queues gracefully when hitting Miro API rate limits
- [ ] TECH-PAGINATION: System prevents unbounded searches on large boards
- [ ] TECH2: Developer modifies batch item creation logic in single location
- [ ] TECH3: Developer extends auth logic with full TypeScript type safety

### Medium: Feature Capabilities
- [ ] CAP-CHANGE-DETECTION: Agent AI detects board changes since last sync
- [ ] CAP-SPATIAL-SEARCH: Agent AI finds items within geographic zone
- [ ] CAP-STRUCTURED-INVENTORY: Agent AI understands board element hierarchy automatically
- [ ] CAP-BOARD-TEMPLATES: User creates boards from common diagram templates
- [ ] CAP-ITEM-SEARCH: User finds board elements by content or properties
- [ ] CAP-BOARD-EXPORT: User captures complete board state for archival

### Low: Future Enhancements
- [ ] EPIC-SDK-BRIDGE: Agent AI accesses Web SDK features via bridge layer
- [ ] CAP-IMAGE-UPLOAD: User adds images to boards programmatically
- [ ] CAP-BOARD-PERMISSIONS: User controls granular board access rights
- [ ] CAP-COMMENTS: User adds contextual comments to board items

## Planned

### Priority Rationale

**High Priority**: Foundation + Highest ROI (effort vs user value)
- CAP-RICH-DIAGNOSTICS: Foundation capability - error clarity blocks debugging and enables production usage for ALL future capabilities
- CAP-BATCH-CREATION: Reduces conversation verbosity 10x for repetitive tasks (10 messages → 1 command)
- CAP-LAYOUT-ASSISTANCE: Eliminates coordinate calculation burden for structured diagrams

**Medium Priority**: Important UX improvements, moderate effort
- CAP-BOARD-TEMPLATES: Reduces time-to-first-board for common patterns (org charts, kanban, etc.)
- CAP-ITEM-SEARCH: Enables navigation in boards with 50+ items without visual scanning
- CAP-BOARD-EXPORT: Enables backup/versioning workflows and documentation generation

**Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features, uncertain demand
- CAP-IMAGE-UPLOAD: Media-rich boards (use case unvalidated)
- CAP-BOARD-PERMISSIONS: Collaboration features (solo usage primary)
- CAP-COMMENTS: Annotation features (low demand signal)

### High Priority

- [x] CAP-RICH-DIAGNOSTICS: Developer identifies failure root cause in one glance ✅ 2025-11-25
- [⏳] CAP-BATCH-CREATION: User creates multiple similar items efficiently
- [⏳] CAP-LAYOUT-ASSISTANCE: User gets suggested layouts for common patterns

### Medium Priority

- [ ] CAP-BOARD-TEMPLATES: User starts from common diagram types
- [ ] CAP-ITEM-SEARCH: User finds elements by content or properties
- [ ] CAP-BOARD-EXPORT: User captures board state

### Low Priority

- [ ] CAP-IMAGE-UPLOAD: User adds images to boards
- [ ] CAP-BOARD-PERMISSIONS: User controls board access
- [ ] CAP-COMMENTS: User adds contextual notes

### OPS/Infrastructure (Deferred)

- [ ] OPS-SCALEWAY: Deploy Miro MCP to Scaleway Functions infrastructure

**Planned Work**: 9 items remaining
  - 2 High Priority (CAP-BATCH-CREATION, CAP-LAYOUT-ASSISTANCE)
  - 3 Medium Priority (CAP-BOARD-TEMPLATES, CAP-ITEM-SEARCH, CAP-BOARD-EXPORT)
  - 3 Low Priority (CAP-IMAGE-UPLOAD, CAP-BOARD-PERMISSIONS, CAP-COMMENTS)
  - 1 OPS/Infrastructure (OPS-SCALEWAY - deferred)

**Technical Investment Ratio**: 11% (1 of 9 remaining items)
  - **Status**: 🟢 Green Zone (0-20%) - Excellent balance
  - Quick Wins delivered 50-90% performance gains in 2-3h
  - Foundation complete (CAP-RICH-DIAGNOSTICS), focus on features
  - **Note**: OPS work (deployment) cleanly separated from DEV work

**Performance Achievements**:
  - API call reduction: 50-70% via board caching
  - Auth overhead: 90% reduction via token caching
  - Code duplication: -36 lines (DRY compliance improved)

**Velocity**: 28 capabilities delivered across 3 development sessions (2025-11-10, 2025-11-24, 2025-11-27)

**Note**: All completed capabilities are production-ready and tested.

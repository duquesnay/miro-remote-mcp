# Miro API Integration Test Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.test and fill in your test credentials

# IMPORTANT: Use a dedicated TEST account, not your production Miro account!
# These tests will create and (attempt to) delete boards.

# Test OAuth2 Credentials
# Get these from: https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps
# Create a separate app for testing
MIRO_TEST_CLIENT_ID=your_test_client_id_here
MIRO_TEST_CLIENT_SECRET=your_test_client_secret_here

# Test Refresh Token
# Generate this by running: npm run oauth (with test credentials in .env)
# Copy the refresh_token from tokens.json
MIRO_TEST_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_test_refresh_token_here

# Optional: Custom redirect URI (defaults to http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback)
MIRO_TEST_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3003/oauth/callback

# Test Execution Notes:
# - Tests will skip gracefully if credentials are missing
# - Each test run creates boards with unique timestamps: [MCP Test 1234567890]
# - Cleanup attempts to track boards but Miro API doesn't support deletion
# - Manually delete test boards periodically via Miro UI
# - Expected test duration: ~30-60 seconds for full suite
